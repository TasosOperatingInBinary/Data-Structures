# Additional Information about the repository:

## **Stack Data Structure:**
If you want to use the stack implementation code you should include both stack.h and stack.cpp files inside your client  .cpp file so that the compiler and the linker can find the implementation of the class stack because we use a template for this class so it can be used for every element of any data type.Also the template works with every input in the STACK_SIZE parameter.If the STACK_SIZE is less or equal than 0 then we construct by default a stack with size equal to 10.You can change that by changing the value of #define macro inside the stack.h file.

## **Queue Data Structure:**
If you want to use the queue implementation code you should include both queue.h and queue.cpp files inside your client  .cpp file so that the compiler and the linker can find the implementation of the class queue because we use a template for this class so it can be used for every element of any data type.Also the template works with every input in the QUEUE_SIZE parameter.If the QUEUE_SIZE is less or equal than 0 then we construct by default a queue with size equal to 10.You can change that by changing the value of #define macro inside the queue.h file.
